# CruiserJumpPractice

A Lethal Company mod that saves/loads cruiser position, rotation, and condition, and lets you toggle the magnet remotely.

This mod helps you practice cruiser jumps repeatedly without having to manually reset the cruiser every attempt.

Only the host can use all features of this mod. Clients will still receive the synced cruiser state even without this mod installed.

Using it together with [giosuel/Imperium](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/giosuel/Imperium/) is recommended to spawn instantly and set up the cruiser easily. CruiserJumpPractice itself does not include these spawn/setup features.

## What it does

- Keybind to save the current cruiser state (position, rotation, HP, turbo boosts).
- Keybind to load the saved cruiser state.
- Keybind to toggle the magnet on/off remotely.

## Who needs to install

Host only.

Clients cannot use all features even if they install this mod.

## Keybinds

You can change the keybinds from the [Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils/) settings menu.

- Save Cruiser State: `[` (US: `[`, JP109: `@`)
- Load Cruiser State: `]` (US: `]`, JP109: `[`)
- Toggle Magnet: `\` (US: `\`, JP109: `]`)
